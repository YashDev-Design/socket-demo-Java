# 📡 Java Socket Communication Demo (Client–Server)

This project demonstrates **TCP socket communication in Java** using a simple **Date Server** and **Date Client**.  
It simulates communication between **two devices on the same WiFi network**, even when run on a single machine.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how **sockets** enable communication between programs using:

- **IP Address**
- **Port Number**
- **TCP protocol**
- **Client–Server architecture**

The server sends the **current date and time** to the client when a connection is established.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

| Concept | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Socket | Endpoint for communication |
| IP + Port | Identifies a service on a machine |
| ServerSocket | Waits for incoming connections |
| Socket | Represents client-server connection |
| TCP | Reliable, connection-oriented protocol |
| Loopback | `127.0.0.1` refers to local machine |
| Network IP | Used to simulate different devices |

Server started... Waiting for client
```

---

### 6️⃣ Run Client (Terminal 2)

## 🌐 Simulating Different Devices on Same WiFi

Instead of using loopback (`127.0.0.1`), use your **real WiFi IP**.

### Get your IP address:

```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

Example output:

```
192.168.1.42
```

### Modify client:

```java
Socket sock = new Socket("192.168.1.42", 6013);
```

Recompile:

```bash
javac DateClient.java
```

Now the connection behaves as if it’s between **two different devices** on the same network.

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

Check server port:

```bash
lsof -i :6013
```

Check listening state:

```bash
netstat -an | grep 6013
```

---

## 📶 Communication Flow

```
Client → Request Connection → Server (Port 6013)
Server → Sends Date → Client
Connection Closed
```

---

## 🏫 Academic Relevance

This project demonstrates:

- Socket creation  
- TCP communication  
- Stream reading/writing  
- Server listening loop  
- Client-server architecture  
- Real IP vs Loopback networking

# 📡 Advanced Java Socket Communication Demo (Client–Server with WiFi Detection)

This project demonstrates **TCP socket communication in Java** with **real network interface detection** and **LAN server discovery**.

It proves that the client and server communicate over an **actual WiFi network**, not loopback (`127.0.0.1`).  
The program was tested successfully by switching between:

- Home WiFi  
- Mobile Hotspot  

The IP address changed accordingly, and communication continued to work — confirming real network-based socket communication.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate:

- TCP socket programming  
- Client–Server architecture  
- LAN-based communication  
- Real WiFi IP detection  
- Server discovery on the same subnet  

---

## 🧠 Key Features Implemented

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| WiFi Interface Detection | Program fetches real IPv4 from network interface (en0) |
| Loopback Avoidance | Prevents `127.0.0.1` from being used |
| LAN Server Discovery | Client scans subnet for active servers |
| Server Identification | Server sends its name and WiFi IP |
| Interactive Selection | Client selects server from discovered list |
| Cross-Network Test | Works when switching WiFi networks |

├── DateClient.java   → LAN scanner + interactive client
└── README.md
```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- macOS / Linux / Windows  
- Java JDK installed

Check Java:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

---

## 🌐 Step 1 — Confirm Your WiFi IP Address

Before running the programs, verify your system is connected to WiFi:

```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

Example outputs (network changes depending on WiFi):

| Network | IP Address |
|---------|------------|
| Home WiFi | 192.168.0.10 |
| Mobile Hotspot | 172.20.10.5 |

This proves the device is connected to a real network.

---

## 🚀 Step 2 — Compile Programs

```bash
javac DateServer.java
javac DateClient.java
```

---

## 🖥️ Step 3 — Run Server

```bash
java DateServer
```

Example output:

```
==================================
Javeed's Socket Server Started
Connected to WiFi IP: 192.168.0.10
Port: 6013
==================================
```

This confirms the server is bound to the WiFi network.

---

## 💻 Step 4 — Run Client

```bash
java DateClient
```

Example:

```
==================================
Client running on WiFi IP: 192.168.0.10
Scanning for socket servers on same WiFi network...
==================================

Available Servers:
1. 192.168.0.10 - Javeed's Socket Server

Select server number to connect: 1
```

---

## 🔗 Step 5 — Connection Established

```
==================================
Connection Established Over WiFi
Connected to Server: Javeed's Socket Server
Server WiFi IP: 192.168.0.10
Client WiFi IP: 192.168.0.10
Server Date & Time: Wed Feb 05 14:22:01 CST 2026
==================================
```

## 🧪 Network Switching Test

The system was tested by switching networks:

| Scenario | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Home WiFi → Mobile Hotspot | IP changed automatically |
| Server restarted | Bound to new IP |
| Client scan | Discovered server on new subnet |
| Connection | Successful |

This proves communication is happening over **real LAN networking**.

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

Check server listening on WiFi IP:

```bash
lsof -i :6013
```

Check network interface:

```bash
ifconfig en0 | grep inet
```

---

## 📶 Communication Flow

```
Client scans subnet → Finds server → User selects server
→ TCP connection established → Server sends name, IP, date
```

---
